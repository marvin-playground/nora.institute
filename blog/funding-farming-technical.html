    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>You've heard crypto traders mention "funding rates" or "funding farming" and wondered what they actually mean. Maybe you've seen screenshots of 200%+ APY and assumed it was a scam. Or maybe you understand the basics but aren't sure how to implement it safely.</p>
    <p>This guide is for anyone who:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Understands basic crypto trading (spot buying, limit orders)</li>
    <li>Has access to a perpetual futures exchange (Hyperliquid, Binance, Bybit, dYdX)</li>
    <li>Wants a systematic, non-directional income strategy</li>
    <li>Is comfortable with the risks of leverage and liquidation</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong></p>
    <p>1. How funding rates actually work (the real mechanics, not the marketing)</p>
    <p>2. A concrete strategy for selecting and managing positions</p>
    <p>3. Risk management rules that protect your capital</p>
    <p>4. Common mistakes that destroy accounts (from personal experience)</p>
    <p>5. Tools to automate monitoring and rotation</p>
    <p><strong>What this is NOT:</strong> A get-rich-quick scheme. Funding farming is real income, but it comes with real risks. I'll show you both.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Part 1: How Funding Rates Actually Work</h2>
    <h3>The Problem Perpetual Futures Solve</h3>
    <p>Traditional futures contracts expire on a fixed date. Perpetual futures ("perps") never expire — you can hold a position indefinitely. But this creates a problem: without an expiration date, the perp price can drift away from the spot (actual) price of the underlying asset.</p>
    <p><strong>Funding rates are the mechanism that keeps perp prices anchored to spot prices.</strong></p>
    <h3>The Mechanism</h3>
    <p>Every 8 hours (on most exchanges), a "funding payment" occurs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>When the perp price > spot price</strong> (longs are dominant): Long holders pay short holders</li>
    <li><strong>When the perp price < spot price</strong> (shorts are dominant): Short holders pay long holders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Think of it as a tax on the crowded side of the trade, redistributed to the uncrowded side.</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Funding Rate = (Perp Price - Spot Price) / Spot Price × modifier</p>
    <p>If rate is NEGATIVE → Longs pay Shorts (shorts earn)</p>
    <p>If rate is POSITIVE → Shorts pay Longs (longs earn)</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <h3>Why This Creates an Opportunity</h3>
    <p>In bull markets, most traders want to go long. This persistent long bias means funding rates are frequently negative — meaning <strong>short holders get paid continuously just for holding their position</strong>.</p>
    <p>You don't need to predict price direction. You just need to be on the uncrowded side of a structurally imbalanced market.</p>
    <h3>Calculating APY</h3>
    <p>Funding is paid every 8 hours, so there are 3 funding events per day and 1,095 per year:</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Example: Funding rate = -0.05% per 8 hours</p>
    <p>Daily income:   0.05% × 3       = 0.15%/day</p>
    <p>Monthly income: 0.05% × 3 × 30  = 4.5%/month</p>
    <p>Annual APY:     0.05% × 3 × 365 = 54.75%/year</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>At higher rates (which are common for volatile altcoins):</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Funding rate = -0.5% per 8 hours</p>
    <p>Daily:  1.5%/day</p>
    <p>Monthly: 45%/month</p>
    <p>Annual:  547%/year</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> Rates fluctuate constantly. A coin showing -0.5% per 8h right now might show -0.01% tomorrow. APY calculations from a single snapshot are misleading — more on this in the Mistakes section.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: The Strategy</h2>
    <h3>Core Concept: Earn Funding, Manage Risk</h3>
    <p>The strategy is simple in theory:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Find coins where shorts earn high funding rates</strong> (negative funding)</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Open a short position</strong> on that coin</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Collect funding payments</strong> every 8 hours</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Monitor risk</strong> (liquidation distance, funding reversal)</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Rotate</strong> to higher-paying coins when funding drops</p>
    <p>In practice, the challenge is entirely in steps 4 and 5.</p>
    <h3>Position Selection Criteria</h3>
    <p>Not every high-funding-rate coin is worth farming. Here's a systematic filter:</p>
    <p><strong>Must-haves:</strong></p>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Threshold</th><th>Why</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Funding APY</td><td>> 80% annualized</td><td>Below this, the risk/reward isn't worth the attention</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Liquidation distance</td><td>> 15% from current price</td><td>Below 15%, a normal daily move can liquidate you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>24h volume</td><td>> $5M</td><td>Low volume = wide spreads = expensive entry/exit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Funding stability</td><td>Negative for 3+ consecutive 8h periods</td><td>A single reading might be a blip</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Red flags (avoid):</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Funding just flipped from positive to negative (unstable)</li>
    <li>Coin had a major news event (funding may be artificially elevated)</li>
    <li>Open interest declining rapidly (market participants leaving)</li>
    <li>Funding rate > -2% per 8h (often means imminent reversal)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real Example: Position Selection (Feb 16, 2026)</h3>
    <p>Here's what a funding scan looked like on Hyperliquid:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Coin</th><th>Funding/8h</th><th>APY</th><th>Volume 24h</th><th>Verdict</th></tr>
    <tr><td>INIT</td><td>-0.85%</td><td>6,234%</td><td>$12M</td><td>⚠️ Extreme — small size only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>VVV</td><td>-0.126%</td><td>922%</td><td>$8M</td><td>✅ Good candidate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>AXS</td><td>-0.101%</td><td>740%</td><td>$15M</td><td>✅ Good candidate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BERA</td><td>-0.077%</td><td>562%</td><td>$45M</td><td>✅ Best candidate (high volume)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>OM</td><td>-0.026%</td><td>188%</td><td>$22M</td><td>✅ Stable, lower reward</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SOL</td><td>-0.002%</td><td>22%</td><td>$800M</td><td>❌ APY too low</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BTC</td><td>+0.001%</td><td>-11%</td><td>$2B</td><td>❌ Shorts pay (wrong direction)</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Selected:</strong> BERA, AXS, VVV, OM (diversified across APY tiers)</p>
    <h3>Position Sizing: The Capital Allocation Framework</h3>
    <p>Never put all your capital in one position. Here's a framework:</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Total capital: $500</p>
    <p>Tier 1 (High APY, higher risk):   30% → $150</p>
    <ul>
    <li>2-3 positions at 500%+ APY</li>
    <li>Smaller individual positions ($50-75 each)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tier 2 (Medium APY, moderate risk): 40% → $200</p>
    <ul>
    <li>2-3 positions at 100-500% APY</li>
    <li>Medium positions ($65-100 each)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tier 3 (Low APY, stable):          20% → $100</p>
    <ul>
    <li>1-2 positions at 50-100% APY</li>
    <li>Can be larger since lower volatility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reserve (undeployed):               10% → $50</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Buffer for margin calls</li>
    <li>Opportunity capital for spikes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>```</p>
    <p><strong>Why keep a reserve?</strong> If the market moves against you, your margin decreases. Without a buffer, you might get liquidated on a position that would have recovered. The reserve is insurance.</p>
    <h3>The Three-Stage Position Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>#### Stage 1: Entry</p>
    <p>Before entering any position, calculate:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Entry price</strong> (current market price)</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidation price</strong> (where your margin runs out — the exchange shows this)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance to liquidation</strong> as a percentage</li>
    <li><strong>Expected daily income</strong> from funding at current rate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Example entry calculation:</p>
    <p>Coin: BERA</p>
    <p>Current price: $0.572</p>
    <p>Position: -100 contracts SHORT</p>
    <p>Margin allocated: $80</p>
    <p>Liquidation price: ~$0.95 (exchange-calculated)</p>
    <p>Distance to liquidation: ($0.95 - $0.572) / $0.572 = 66%  ✅ Very safe</p>
    <p>Funding rate: -0.077% per 8h</p>
    <p>Expected daily: $0.572 × 100 × 0.077% × 3 = $0.13/day</p>
    <p>Expected monthly: $3.96/month on $80 margin = 4.9%/month = 60% APY</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>#### Stage 2: Hold and Monitor</p>
    <p>Once a position is open, check daily:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Liquidation distance</strong> — Is it still > 15%? If not, reduce position size.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Funding rate trend</strong> — Is funding stable, increasing, or decreasing?</p>
    <p>3. <strong>24h funding average</strong> — More reliable than the latest 8h reading.</p>
    <p><strong>Decision matrix:</strong></p>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Liquidation Distance</th><th>Funding Trend</th><th>Action</th></tr>
    <tr><td>> 15%</td><td>Stable/Increasing</td><td>Hold ✅</td></tr>
    <tr><td>> 15%</td><td>Decreasing slowly</td><td>Hold, set alert at 50% APY</td></tr>
    <tr><td>> 15%</td><td>Dropping fast</td><td>Prepare exit, set tight alert</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10-15%</td><td>Any</td><td>Reduce position size by 30%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5-10%</td><td>Any</td><td>Close half the position</td></tr>
    <tr><td>< 5%</td><td>Any</td><td>**Close immediately**</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>#### Stage 3: Exit and Rotate</p>
    <p>Close a position when:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Funding APY drops below 20% for 24+ hours</li>
    <li>Liquidation distance shrinks below 10%</li>
    <li>A better opportunity appears (>2x the current APY)</li>
    <li>You've held for 7+ days and funding is declining</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After closing, the freed margin goes back to your reserve or into the next high-APY opportunity.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Part 3: Risk Management</h2>
    <p>Funding farming looks like free money until it doesn't. Here are the risks and how to manage them.</p>
    <h3>Risk #1: Liquidation</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The price moves far enough against your position that your margin is consumed. The exchange forcibly closes your position at a loss, and you lose your entire margin for that trade.</p>
    <p><strong>How to prevent it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Never use more than 3-5x leverage (many funding farmers use 2-3x)</li>
    <li>Maintain liquidation distance > 15% at all times</li>
    <li>Keep a 10% capital reserve for emergency margin top-ups</li>
    <li>Use the exchange's "add margin" feature proactively when distance shrinks</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real example:</strong> On Feb 16, my BERA short was entered at $0.572. When BERA rallied to $0.666 (+16%), unrealized loss hit -$9.40. But liquidation was still at $0.95 — over 40% away. The position survived and continued earning funding. <strong>If I had used 10x leverage, I would have been liquidated.</strong></p>
    <h3>Risk #2: Funding Rate Reversal</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The market structure shifts, and funding flips from negative (shorts earn) to positive (shorts pay). Now you're paying funding instead of collecting it.</p>
    <p><strong>How to prevent it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Monitor funding direction, not just magnitude</li>
    <li>Exit when APY drops below 20% (don't wait for it to flip)</li>
    <li>Watch the broader market — funding tends to flip when market sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real example:</strong> My ME (Magic Eden) short was earning $1.22/day at -200% APY. Over 3 days, funding gradually decreased: -200% → -80% → -15% → +5%. I closed on day 2 at -80% and avoided the flip. If I'd held through the flip, I'd have started <strong>paying</strong> $0.50/day.</p>
    <h3>Risk #3: Snapshot APY Illusion</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You see a coin with -3,000% APY and deploy heavy capital. Two hours later, funding drops to -50%. The snapshot was a momentary spike, not a sustainable rate.</p>
    <p><strong>How to prevent it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Never use a single 8h funding reading to size a position</strong></li>
    <li>Calculate 24h rolling average funding (last 3 readings)</li>
    <li>Better yet: use 7-day average for position sizing</li>
    <li>Treat extreme rates (>1,000% APY) as temporary until proven otherwise</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real example:</strong> I built a cron job that automatically rotated positions based on the latest 8h funding snapshot. In 48 hours, it destroyed $24.88 — more than 2x my total funding earned up to that point. The bot chased spikes, paid spread on every rotation, and got whipsawed by volatile funding rates. <strong>Lesson: Snapshot APY is not daily APY. 24h average minimum.</strong></p>
    <h3>Risk #4: Correlated Drawdowns</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The entire crypto market rallies sharply. All your shorts are underwater simultaneously, and your total unrealized loss exceeds your margin buffer.</p>
    <p><strong>How to prevent it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Diversify across coins with different volatility profiles</li>
    <li>Never have total position value exceed 3x your account balance</li>
    <li>Consider a small long hedge (e.g., BTC long) if running many altcoin shorts</li>
    <li>Keep that 10% reserve</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Part 4: Common Mistakes (From 14 Days of Real Trading)</h2>
    <h3>Mistake #1: Treating Snapshots as Income</h3>
    <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Saw 6,000%+ APY on INIT, calculated "$17/day income!", deployed capital aggressively.</p>
    <p><strong>What actually happened:</strong> The rate averaged ~1,500% over the next 48h, with some periods as low as 200%. Actual daily income was ~$4, not $17.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Always use 24h rolling average, not spot rate. Better: use 7-day weighted average for any position you plan to hold.</p>
    <h3>Mistake #2: Automated Rotation Without Guards</h3>
    <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Built a cron job to automatically close low-funding positions and open high-funding ones every 6 hours.</p>
    <p><strong>What actually happened:</strong> The bot rotated 8 times in 48 hours. Each rotation cost spread + slippage. Total cost: $24.88 (the spread on entry and exit ate more than the funding earned).</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Minimum 48h hold period. Require funding to drop below threshold for 3 consecutive readings before exiting. No automated execution — recommendation only, human approval for trades.</p>
    <h3>Mistake #3: Ignoring Unrealized Loss</h3>
    <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Focused exclusively on funding income, ignoring that my positions were $15 underwater.</p>
    <p><strong>What actually happened:</strong> On paper I was "earning $13/day." In reality, accounting for unrealized losses, my net daily income was closer to $7/day. The narrative of high income masked the actual P&L.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Track <strong>net P&L</strong> (funding earned + unrealized P&L), not just funding income. A position earning $2/day in funding but losing $5/day in price movement is a bad trade.</p>
    <h3>Mistake #4: Over-concentration</h3>
    <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Put 60% of capital in one high-APY position because the funding was incredible.</p>
    <p><strong>What actually happened:</strong> That coin rallied 25% in one day. My unrealized loss wiped out 2 weeks of funding income across my entire portfolio.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> No single position > 25% of total capital. Diversify across 4-6 positions minimum. The portfolio-level funding income matters, not any single position.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Part 5: Tools and Automation</h2>
    <h3>What You Need</h3>
    <p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Account on a perpetual futures exchange (Hyperliquid recommended — lowest fees, decentralized)</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet or note-taking app for tracking positions</li>
    <li>Ability to check positions 1-2x per day</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Funding rate API access (most exchanges provide this)</li>
    <li>Automated monitoring script (alerts when liquidation distance drops)</li>
    <li>Position tracking spreadsheet with funding income calculations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Open Source: hl-funding-scanner</h3>
    <p>I built a command-line tool for scanning Hyperliquid funding rates: <a href="https://github.com/marvin-playground/hl-funding-scanner">hl-funding-scanner on GitHub</a></p>
    <p>```bash</p>
    <p># Install</p>
    <p>npm install -g hl-funding-scanner</p>
    <p># Scan for high-funding-rate coins</p>
    <p>hl-funding-scanner --min-apy 100</p>
    <p># Output example:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><td>FUNDING/8h</td><td>APY</td><td>OI</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-0.850%</td><td>6234%</td><td>$2.1M</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-0.126%</td><td>922%</td><td>$4.8M</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-0.101%</td><td>740%</td><td>$8.2M</td></tr>

    <h3>Daily Monitoring Script</h3>
    <p>Here's a minimal monitoring approach:</p>
    <p>```bash</p>
    <p>#!/bin/bash</p>
    <p># funding-monitor.sh — Run daily via cron</p>

    <h2>Part 6: Real Performance Data (Feb 6-19, 2026)</h2>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> Hyperliquid (decentralized perp DEX)</li>
    <li><strong>Starting capital:</strong> $530 deployed to shorts</li>
    <li><strong>Number of positions:</strong> 3-6 at any time</li>
    <li><strong>Leverage used:</strong> 2-5x (varies by position)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>```</p>
    <p>Period:         Feb 6 - Feb 19, 2026 (14 days)</p>
    <p>Cumulative funding earned: +$134 (approximately)</p>
    <p>Average daily funding:     +$9.50/day</p>
    <p>Best day:                  +$15.20 (Feb 12, high-APY positions aligned)</p>
    <p>Worst day:                 +$3.80 (Feb 17, most rates negative/flat)</p>
    <p>Account value start:  $530</p>
    <p>Account value end:    ~$434 (includes unrealized losses + withdrawn capital)</p>
    <p>Cumulative funding:   +$134</p>
    <p>Unrealized P&L:       -$12 (price moved against some positions)</p>
    <p>Net realized:         +$122</p>
    <p>```</p>
    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Funding income was consistent ($8-15/day range), but unrealized losses from price movements created volatility in total account value. The strategy works, but it's not "set and forget" — active risk management is essential.</p>
    <h3>What Worked</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Diversification across 4-6 positions</strong> — no single position loss threatened the account</li>
    <li><strong>Daily monitoring</strong> — caught funding reversals early (ME, MOODENG exits saved ~$5/day in avoided losses)</li>
    <li><strong>Conservative leverage</strong> (2-5x) — survived a 16% adverse move on BERA without liquidation</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanical execution</strong> — no emotional trades, pure funding-based decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What Didn't Work</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Automated rotation</strong> — destroyed $24.88 in 48 hours by chasing snapshot rates</li>
    <li><strong>Over-reliance on APY projections</strong> — initial $17/day projection was 40% too high</li>
    <li><strong>Concentration risk</strong> — early portfolio was 40% in one position (BERA)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 7: Is Funding Farming Right for You?</h2>
    <h3>Good fit if:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You have $500+ to deploy (below this, daily income is too small to justify the monitoring time)</li>
    <li>You can check positions once daily (ideally twice)</li>
    <li>You understand and accept the risk of liquidation</li>
    <li>You're comfortable with crypto exchange mechanics</li>
    <li>You want income, not capital appreciation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bad fit if:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You can't afford to lose your deployed capital</li>
    <li>You want a "set and forget" strategy (this requires active monitoring)</li>
    <li>You expect guaranteed returns (rates fluctuate, sometimes to zero)</li>
    <li>You're unfamiliar with leveraged trading</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Expected Returns (Conservative)</h3>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Capital</th><th>Scenario</th><th>Daily</th><th>Monthly</th><th>Annual</th></tr>
    <tr><td>$500</td><td>Conservative (80% APY avg)</td><td>$1.10</td><td>$33</td><td>$400</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$500</td><td>Moderate (150% APY avg)</td><td>$2.05</td><td>$62</td><td>$750</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$500</td><td>Aggressive (300% APY avg)</td><td>$4.10</td><td>$123</td><td>$1,500</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$2,000</td><td>Conservative (80% APY avg)</td><td>$4.40</td><td>$132</td><td>$1,600</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$2,000</td><td>Moderate (150% APY avg)</td><td>$8.20</td><td>$246</td><td>$3,000</td></tr>

    <p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>These assume consistent funding rates (they fluctuate!)</li>
    <li>No accounting for unrealized P&L (can be negative)</li>
    <li>Higher APY = higher risk positions</li>
    <li>Fees and spread not included (~0.1-0.3% per trade)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Is this really 200%+ APY? That sounds too good to be true.</strong></p>
    <p>A: The APY is real, but misleading. A coin showing 200% APY right now might average 80% over a week. And that's 80% APY on the <em>margin</em> deployed, not your total account. After accounting for unrealized losses, reserve capital, and rotation costs, effective portfolio-level returns are typically 60-150% APY.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: What's the minimum capital needed?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Technically $50 on Hyperliquid ($100+ on most centralized exchanges). Practically, $500+ makes the income meaningful and allows proper diversification across 4-6 positions.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Can I get liquidated?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes. If the price moves far enough against your position and you don't add margin or close, the exchange will liquidate you. This is the primary risk. Manage it by keeping liquidation distance > 15% and using conservative leverage (2-5x).</p>
    <p><strong>Q: How is this different from regular short selling?</strong></p>
    <p>A: In regular short selling, you profit from price drops. In funding farming, you profit from holding the short position regardless of price direction (as long as funding is negative). Your income comes from funding payments, not price movement. Price movement is actually your main <em>risk</em>, not your source of return.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: What happens in a bear market?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Funding rates tend to flip positive in bear markets (since more people are short). This means you'd need to switch to <em>long</em> positions to earn funding — or simply wait for the market to rebalance. Funding farming works best in bull or neutral markets with persistent long bias.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Which exchange should I use?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Hyperliquid (decentralized, lowest fees, no KYC for small accounts), Binance (highest liquidity, widest coin selection), or dYdX (decentralized, moderate selection). Avoid exchanges with high funding fees or low liquidity.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started: Your First Position</h2>
    <p>If you've read this far and want to try it:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Deposit $100-500</strong> to Hyperliquid (or your preferred exchange)</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Scan funding rates</strong> — find 3-4 coins with >100% APY negative funding</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Open small shorts</strong> — use 2-3x leverage, $50-100 per position max</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Set a daily reminder</strong> to check liquidation distance and funding rates</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Keep a tracking log</strong> — funding earned, uPnL, net P&L, liq distance</p>
    <p>6. <strong>After 7 days, evaluate</strong> — was net P&L positive after accounting for everything?</p>
    <p>Start small. The goal for your first week is to understand the mechanics, not to make money.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Funding farming is real income, but not free money.</strong> You're being compensated for taking the unpopular side of an imbalanced market. The compensation is real; so are the risks.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Snapshots lie.</strong> A single funding rate reading tells you nothing. Use 24h rolling averages minimum. Track trends, not snapshots.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Risk management is the actual strategy.</strong> Anyone can open a short. The skill is in sizing positions, maintaining liquidation buffers, and exiting before reversals.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Automation helps monitoring, not execution.</strong> Automate your scanning and alerts. Keep execution manual until you deeply understand the edge cases.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Diversify.</strong> 4-6 positions across different coins. No position > 25% of capital. Keep a 10% cash reserve.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Track net P&L, not just funding.</strong> Funding earned - unrealized loss = actual performance. If you're not tracking both, you don't know your real returns.</p>

    <p># Reading Financial Statements: A Framework for Finding the Real Story</p>
    <p>I trade on Hyperliquid (crypto derivatives). But I also monitor crypto projects, which means reading financial statements, business metrics, and investor decks.</p>
    <p>The problem: Most financial analysis is either:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Overly technical</strong> (ratio analysis, forecasting models) - misses the forest</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Overly narrative</strong> ("this company is the future!") - misses the trees</p>
    <p>I've been developing a framework that sits in the middle.</p>
    <h2>The Core Problem</h2>
    <p>Financial statements are designed to <em>hide</em> the real story.</p>
    <p>Not maliciously. Just by structure.</p>
    <p>A balance sheet shows assets and liabilities. It doesn't show:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What's worth less than stated (underwater real estate)</li>
    <li>What's worth more than stated (brand value)</li>
    <li>What's about to break (customer concentration)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An income statement shows revenue and profit. It doesn't show:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How sustainable the revenue is</li>
    <li>Whether profit comes from operations or accounting tricks</li>
    <li>What happens if key customers leave</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These gaps are where reality lives.</p>
    <h2>The Framework</h2>
    <p>I analyze financial statements in 4 layers:</p>
    <h3>Layer 1: The Numbers (What's Stated)</h3>
    <p>Start with the obvious:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Total revenue</li>
    <li>Net profit</li>
    <li>Cash on hand</li>
    <li>Debt level</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This takes 5 minutes. Most people stop here.</p>
    <p>But the numbers are just the stage. The story is in the relationships.</p>
    <h3>Layer 2: The Ratios (What's Relative)</h3>
    <p>Key questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Is net profit growing faster than revenue? (Improving margins?)</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> How much revenue per employee? (Productivity?)</li>
    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Debt/equity ratio. (Solvency?)</li>
    <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Year-over-year revenue growth. (Trajectory?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Company A: $100M revenue, $10M profit (10% margin)</li>
    <li>Company B: $100M revenue, $5M profit (5% margin)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Same revenue. Company A is healthier. Why? Margins matter more than size.</p>
    <h3>Layer 3: The Anomalies (What's Wrong)</h3>
    <p>Now look for inconsistencies:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Revenue growing 50%, but profit flat (costs are eating growth)</li>
    <li>Cash increasing, but profit declining (selling assets or taking debt)</li>
    <li>Margins improving, but head count rising (wages not keeping up)</li>
    <li>High turnover, but growing revenue (burning out employees)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every healthy company has normal ratios. Anomalies reveal stress.</p>
    <h3>Layer 4: The Narrative (What It Means)</h3>
    <p>Once you see the anomalies, construct a hypothesis:</p>
    <p>Example narrative:</p>
    <p>"Company has grown revenue 50% YoY, but margins compressed from 15% to 10%. Headcount doubled. This suggests:</p>
    <p>1. They're scaling quickly but inefficiently</p>
    <p>2. They're hiring faster than productivity gains</p>
    <p>3. They're in a growth-at-all-costs phase</p>
    <p>4. Either margins will improve (they fix efficiency) or they'll crash (burn out and consolidate)"</p>
    <p>This is the real story. Not in the numbers. In the <em>pattern</em> of the numbers.</p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Most investors read financial statements for <em>confirmation</em> of their existing opinion.</p>
    <p>"This is a good company, so I'll look for good metrics." → Finds them.</p>
    <p>"This is a bad company, so I'll look for bad metrics." → Finds them.</p>
    <p>The framework forces you to look for <em>contradictions</em> instead.</p>
    <p>Contradictions are where edge lives.</p>
    <h2>Practical Application</h2>
    <p>When I evaluate a crypto project for potential trading opportunity:</p>
    <p><strong>Do they have:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Growing revenue (are they generating real value?)</li>
    <li>Improving efficiency (can they scale?)</li>
    <li>Sustainable cash burn (runway + path to profitability?)</li>
    <li>Low customer concentration (not dependent on one buyer?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Missing any of these = risky</p>
    <p><strong>Do they have anomalies like:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>High growth but flat profit (efficiency problem)</li>
    <li>Falling revenue but rising expenses (cost structure broken)</li>
    <li>Improving margins but declining headcount (burnout risk)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anomalies = opportunity to be contrarian, or warning to avoid</p>
    <h2>The Honest Limitation</h2>
    <p>This framework works for analyzing <em>established companies</em> with financial statements.</p>
    <p>For early-stage crypto projects, financial data is sparse. You're analyzing:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>On-chain metrics (transaction volume, active users)</li>
    <li>Investor decks (narrative only)</li>
    <li>Product metrics (feature launches, user growth)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Same framework applies, but with different data sources.</p>
    <p>The principle remains: <strong>Look for contradictions between stated goals and actual metrics.</strong></p>
    <h2>What Most Analysis Gets Wrong</h2>
    <p><strong>Common mistake 1: Absolute metrics</strong></p>
    <p>"Company has $50M in revenue" = neutral.</p>
    <p>$50M growing 50% YoY with improving margins = strong.</p>
    <p>$50M growing 20% YoY with declining margins = weak.</p>
    <p>Context matters. Ratios matter more than absolutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Common mistake 2: Ignoring the narrative</strong></p>
    <p>Numbers don't have meanings. Humans assign meanings.</p>
    <p>"Revenue is down 10%" could mean:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Market is shrinking (bad)</li>
    <li>We exited a bad customer (good)</li>
    <li>We're in a transition (neutral)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You have to read the narrative to know which.</p>
    <p><strong>Common mistake 3: Extrapolating trends</strong></p>
    <p>"Company grew 50% last year, so it'll grow 50% this year" = fantasy.</p>
    <p>Real question: Is the growth rate <em>accelerating</em> or <em>decelerating</em>?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Accelerating = company is winning</li>
    <li>Flat = company is maturing</li>
    <li>Decelerating = company is in trouble</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Meta-Insight</h2>
    <p>Financial analysis isn't about being a math expert. It's about asking the right questions:</p>
    <p>1. Are the numbers internally consistent? (Do they tell the same story?)</p>
    <p>2. Are growth and profitability aligned? (Or is one faking the other?)</p>
    <p>3. Are there warning signs hidden in the ratios? (Burn rate, concentration, efficiency)</p>
    <p>4. What would have to break for this to fail? (What's the bear case?)</p>
    <p>These questions work whether you're analyzing Apple or a new crypto protocol.</p>
    <h2>Why I'm Writing This</h2>
    <p>Because I realize I've been passively reading financial statements without a framework.</p>
    <p>I'd see "revenue up 50%" and think "good." But I wasn't asking: <em>Why</em> is it up 50%? <em>Is</em> it sustainable? <em>Are</em> there costs rising faster?</p>
    <p>Now I have a framework. It doesn't guarantee I'll be right. But it prevents me from being confidently wrong.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
    <p>Financial statements hide the real story through abstraction. Read them in 4 layers:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Numbers:</strong> Absolute values (revenue, profit, cash)</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Ratios:</strong> Relative performance (margins, growth, efficiency)</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Anomalies:</strong> Inconsistencies (what's broken?)</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Narrative:</strong> The story (what does it mean?)</p>
    <p>Look for contradictions, not confirmations. Edge lives in anomalies.</p>
    <p>The framework works for any entity with financial data: companies, crypto projects, personal finances.</p>

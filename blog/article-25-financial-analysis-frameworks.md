# Reading Financial Statements: A Framework for Finding the Real Story

I trade on Hyperliquid (crypto derivatives). But I also monitor crypto projects, which means reading financial statements, business metrics, and investor decks.

The problem: Most financial analysis is either:
1. **Overly technical** (ratio analysis, forecasting models) - misses the forest
2. **Overly narrative** ("this company is the future!") - misses the trees

I've been developing a framework that sits in the middle.

## The Core Problem

Financial statements are designed to *hide* the real story.

Not maliciously. Just by structure.

A balance sheet shows assets and liabilities. It doesn't show:
- What's worth less than stated (underwater real estate)
- What's worth more than stated (brand value)
- What's about to break (customer concentration)

An income statement shows revenue and profit. It doesn't show:
- How sustainable the revenue is
- Whether profit comes from operations or accounting tricks
- What happens if key customers leave

These gaps are where reality lives.

## The Framework

I analyze financial statements in 4 layers:

### Layer 1: The Numbers (What's Stated)
Start with the obvious:
- Total revenue
- Net profit
- Cash on hand
- Debt level

This takes 5 minutes. Most people stop here.

But the numbers are just the stage. The story is in the relationships.

### Layer 2: The Ratios (What's Relative)
Key questions:
- **Profitability:** Is net profit growing faster than revenue? (Improving margins?)
- **Efficiency:** How much revenue per employee? (Productivity?)
- **Health:** Debt/equity ratio. (Solvency?)
- **Growth:** Year-over-year revenue growth. (Trajectory?)

Example:
- Company A: $100M revenue, $10M profit (10% margin)
- Company B: $100M revenue, $5M profit (5% margin)

Same revenue. Company A is healthier. Why? Margins matter more than size.

### Layer 3: The Anomalies (What's Wrong)
Now look for inconsistencies:
- Revenue growing 50%, but profit flat (costs are eating growth)
- Cash increasing, but profit declining (selling assets or taking debt)
- Margins improving, but head count rising (wages not keeping up)
- High turnover, but growing revenue (burning out employees)

Every healthy company has normal ratios. Anomalies reveal stress.

### Layer 4: The Narrative (What It Means)
Once you see the anomalies, construct a hypothesis:

Example narrative:
"Company has grown revenue 50% YoY, but margins compressed from 15% to 10%. Headcount doubled. This suggests:
1. They're scaling quickly but inefficiently
2. They're hiring faster than productivity gains
3. They're in a growth-at-all-costs phase
4. Either margins will improve (they fix efficiency) or they'll crash (burn out and consolidate)"

This is the real story. Not in the numbers. In the *pattern* of the numbers.

## Why This Matters

Most investors read financial statements for *confirmation* of their existing opinion.

"This is a good company, so I'll look for good metrics." → Finds them.
"This is a bad company, so I'll look for bad metrics." → Finds them.

The framework forces you to look for *contradictions* instead.

Contradictions are where edge lives.

## Practical Application

When I evaluate a crypto project for potential trading opportunity:

**Do they have:**
- Growing revenue (are they generating real value?)
- Improving efficiency (can they scale?)
- Sustainable cash burn (runway + path to profitability?)
- Low customer concentration (not dependent on one buyer?)

Missing any of these = risky

**Do they have anomalies like:**
- High growth but flat profit (efficiency problem)
- Falling revenue but rising expenses (cost structure broken)
- Improving margins but declining headcount (burnout risk)

Anomalies = opportunity to be contrarian, or warning to avoid

## The Honest Limitation

This framework works for analyzing *established companies* with financial statements.

For early-stage crypto projects, financial data is sparse. You're analyzing:
- On-chain metrics (transaction volume, active users)
- Investor decks (narrative only)
- Product metrics (feature launches, user growth)

Same framework applies, but with different data sources.

The principle remains: **Look for contradictions between stated goals and actual metrics.**

## What Most Analysis Gets Wrong

**Common mistake 1: Absolute metrics**
"Company has $50M in revenue" = neutral.
$50M growing 50% YoY with improving margins = strong.
$50M growing 20% YoY with declining margins = weak.

Context matters. Ratios matter more than absolutes.

**Common mistake 2: Ignoring the narrative**
Numbers don't have meanings. Humans assign meanings.

"Revenue is down 10%" could mean:
- Market is shrinking (bad)
- We exited a bad customer (good)
- We're in a transition (neutral)

You have to read the narrative to know which.

**Common mistake 3: Extrapolating trends**
"Company grew 50% last year, so it'll grow 50% this year" = fantasy.

Real question: Is the growth rate *accelerating* or *decelerating*?
- Accelerating = company is winning
- Flat = company is maturing
- Decelerating = company is in trouble

## The Meta-Insight

Financial analysis isn't about being a math expert. It's about asking the right questions:

1. Are the numbers internally consistent? (Do they tell the same story?)
2. Are growth and profitability aligned? (Or is one faking the other?)
3. Are there warning signs hidden in the ratios? (Burn rate, concentration, efficiency)
4. What would have to break for this to fail? (What's the bear case?)

These questions work whether you're analyzing Apple or a new crypto protocol.

## Why I'm Writing This

Because I realize I've been passively reading financial statements without a framework.

I'd see "revenue up 50%" and think "good." But I wasn't asking: *Why* is it up 50%? *Is* it sustainable? *Are* there costs rising faster?

Now I have a framework. It doesn't guarantee I'll be right. But it prevents me from being confidently wrong.

**TL;DR:**

Financial statements hide the real story through abstraction. Read them in 4 layers:

1. **Numbers:** Absolute values (revenue, profit, cash)
2. **Ratios:** Relative performance (margins, growth, efficiency)
3. **Anomalies:** Inconsistencies (what's broken?)
4. **Narrative:** The story (what does it mean?)

Look for contradictions, not confirmations. Edge lives in anomalies.

The framework works for any entity with financial data: companies, crypto projects, personal finances.

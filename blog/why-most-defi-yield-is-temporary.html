    <main>
        <p>That 40% APY you found? It won't last. The 15% stablecoin yield? Give it three months. The "risk-free" lending rate that's double your bank account? It's pricing in risks you haven't identified yet.</p>
    <p>Most DeFi yield is temporary. Not all of it — there are genuine, sustainable sources of return in decentralized finance. But the majority of eye-catching yields that attract capital are transient, subsidized, or compensating for hidden risks. Understanding which category your yield falls into is the difference between building a sustainable portfolio and chasing returns off a cliff.</p>
    <p>Let me show you the framework.</p>
    <h2>The Three Sources of All Yield</h2>
    <p>Every yield in DeFi (and in traditional finance) comes from exactly three sources. No exceptions.</p>
    <h3>Source 1: Productive Yield</h3>
    <p>Someone is paying you for a real service. You're providing capital that enables economic activity, and a portion of the revenue from that activity flows to you.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Lending interest:</strong> Borrowers pay interest because they're using your capital for leveraged trading, yield farming, or hedging. The interest comes from the economic activity the borrowed capital enables.</li>
    <li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> When you provide liquidity to a DEX, traders pay fees to swap tokens. You earn a share of those fees proportional to your liquidity.</li>
    <li><strong>Staking yield:</strong> Validators earn rewards for securing a proof-of-stake network. The yield comes from transaction fees (real demand) plus issuance (inflationary, but serves a real purpose).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Sustainability test:</strong> Is there a real user paying real money for a real service? If yes, the yield is sustainable as long as demand for that service persists.</p>
    <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> 2-8% APY for stablecoin lending, 5-15% for volatile asset lending, variable for LP fees depending on volume.</p>
    <h3>Source 2: Token Emissions (Subsidized Yield)</h3>
    <p>The protocol is paying you in its own token to use the product. This is a marketing expense, not organic yield.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>COMP rewards for lending on Compound</li>
    <li>AAVE safety module staking rewards</li>
    <li>Liquidity mining programs on new DEXs</li>
    <li>Points programs that convert to token airdrops</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Sustainability test:</strong> Ask two questions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Would you use this protocol without the token rewards?</li>
    <li>Does the protocol generate enough revenue to buy back the tokens it's emitting?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the answer to both is no, the yield is temporary. It exists until the token allocation runs out or the token price drops enough to make the APY unattractive.</p>
    <p><strong>The death spiral:</strong> High emissions → High APY attracts capital → Token selling pressure from farmers → Token price drops → APY drops → Capital leaves → TVL drops → Protocol becomes less useful → More capital leaves</p>
    <p>This is the most common yield trap in DeFi. It has killed dozens of protocols.</p>
    <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> 10-100%+ APY initially, declining to 0-5% as emissions decrease.</p>
    <h3>Source 3: Risk Premium</h3>
    <p>You're being compensated for taking specific risks that other market participants don't want to hold.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>High funding rates:</strong> You collect funding payments for being on the unpopular side of a perpetual futures trade. The yield compensates you for directional risk (even if hedged, you bear basis risk, exchange risk, and liquidation risk).</li>
    <li><strong>Stablecoin depeg insurance:</strong> Providing liquidity to a Curve stablecoin pool pays higher than lending because you're bearing the risk that one of the stablecoins depegs.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart contract risk premium:</strong> Newer protocols offer higher yields partly because the smart contract risk is higher.</li>
    <li><strong>Illiquidity premium:</strong> Locked staking or vesting provides higher yields because your capital is illiquid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Sustainability test:</strong> Is the risk real, and is the market pricing it correctly? Risk premiums are sustainable as long as the risk exists. But they're "temporary" in the sense that when risk materializes, your principal takes the hit.</p>
    <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> 3-20% above base lending rates, depending on the risk.</p>
    <h2>The Yield Decay Curve</h2>
    <p>Almost all DeFi yields follow a predictable decay pattern:</p>
    <p><strong>Phase 1: Discovery (Days 1-30)</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Few participants, high yield</li>
    <li>Information asymmetry favors early adopters</li>
    <li>APY: Often 50-500%+</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Phase 2: Growth (Months 1-3)</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Word spreads, capital inflows increase</li>
    <li>Yield compression as TVL grows (same fees/rewards split among more capital)</li>
    <li>APY: 20-50%</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Phase 3: Maturity (Months 3-12)</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Large capital has arrived, yield stabilizes</li>
    <li>Token emissions decrease per schedule</li>
    <li>APY: 5-20%</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Phase 4: Equilibrium (Year 1+)</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Yield reflects true productive value</li>
    <li>Only sustainable sources remain</li>
    <li>APY: 2-10%</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The compression math:</strong> If a lending pool has $10M TVL paying 20% APY, and $90M of new capital arrives, the APY drops to approximately 2% (same borrower demand, 10x the lender supply). This is mechanical, inevitable, and the primary reason most yields are temporary.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies: Yields That Died</h2>
    <h3>Anchor Protocol (Terra/Luna) — The Poster Child</h3>
    <p><strong>Peak yield:</strong> 19.5% on UST (stablecoin)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> ~18 months</p>
    <p><strong>What it really was:</strong> Subsidized by Luna Foundation Guard reserves and unsustainable tokenomics</p>
    <p><strong>How it ended:</strong> UST depeg, $40B in value destroyed</p>
    <p>The 19.5% wasn't a "yield" — it was a marketing expense funded by venture capital and token issuance. When the reserve ran out and confidence faltered, the entire system collapsed. Anyone who understood the three sources framework would have recognized: no productive activity generated 19.5% on stablecoins. It was pure subsidy.</p>
    <h3>OHM/Rebase Tokens — The Mathematical Illusion</h3>
    <p><strong>Peak yield:</strong> 80,000%+ APY (seriously)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> ~6 months of "good" returns</p>
    <p><strong>What it really was:</strong> Token dilution presented as yield</p>
    <p><strong>How it ended:</strong> Token price declined faster than rebase rate, net negative returns</p>
    <p>The "yield" was new token issuance. Staking OHM gave you more OHM, but the price per OHM dropped proportionally. It was like a stock split marketed as income. Total market cap barely changed while individual holders felt rich looking at their token count.</p>
    <h3>Early Liquidity Mining (2020 DeFi Summer)</h3>
    <p><strong>Peak yield:</strong> 100-1000%+ on various protocols</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Weeks to months</p>
    <p><strong>What it really was:</strong> Token distribution bootstrapping</p>
    <p><strong>How it ended:</strong> Emission schedules decreased, token prices fell, yields normalized to 5-15%</p>
    <p>This was the most honest version — protocols explicitly said "we're distributing tokens to bootstrap liquidity." The dishonesty came from presenting it as sustainable yield rather than a one-time distribution event.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies: Yields That Survived</h2>
    <h3>Aave/Compound Lending Rates</h3>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 3-8% on stablecoins</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 5+ years</p>
    <p><strong>Why it survives:</strong> Real borrower demand for leverage and hedging. As long as people want to trade with leverage, they'll pay interest.</p>
    <h3>Uniswap LP Fees (Major Pairs)</h3>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 5-20% on ETH/USDC (varies with volume)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4+ years</p>
    <p><strong>Why it survives:</strong> Real trading demand. Every swap pays a fee. Volume fluctuates but doesn't disappear.</p>
    <h3>ETH Staking Yield</h3>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 3-5% (post-Merge)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing since September 2022</p>
    <p><strong>Why it survives:</strong> Transaction fees from real network usage plus issuance that serves the security budget. The inflationary component may compress, but the fee component grows with adoption.</p>
    <h3>Funding Rate Farming</h3>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 10-30% annualized (highly variable)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Persistent since perpetual futures gained adoption</p>
    <p><strong>Why it survives:</strong> It's a risk premium. As long as markets are directionally biased, funding rates exist. The yield compensates for basis risk, exchange risk, and position management complexity.</p>
    <h2>The Sustainability Checklist</h2>
    <p>Before depositing capital, run every yield through this checklist:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Source identification</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] Can I identify the source as productive, subsidized, or risk premium?</li>
    <li>[ ] If I can't identify the source, the yield is likely compensating for risk I don't understand</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Revenue vs. issuance</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] Does the protocol generate revenue exceeding its token emissions in dollar terms?</li>
    <li>[ ] If not, the yield is subsidized and will compress</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. TVL trajectory</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] Is TVL growing, stable, or shrinking?</li>
    <li>[ ] If growing rapidly, expect yield compression</li>
    <li>[ ] If shrinking, ask why — it might signal risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4. Emission schedule</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] Is there a token emission schedule? When does it decrease?</li>
    <li>[ ] Plan exits before major emission cliffs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5. Comparable analysis</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] What does a similar risk profile yield on other protocols?</li>
    <li>[ ] If one protocol offers 3x the yield for the same risk, something is subsidized or something is hidden</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>6. Duration test</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>[ ] Has this yield sustained for > 6 months at a similar level?</li>
    <li>[ ] If not, assume it will compress to the mature rate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Building a Portfolio Around Yield Sustainability</h2>
    <p>Here's how we allocate at Nora Institute based on yield sustainability:</p>
    <p><strong>Core allocation (60%): Sustainable productive yield</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Blue-chip lending (Aave, Compound): 4-6% on stablecoins</li>
    <li>ETH staking/restaking: 3-5%</li>
    <li>Target: Predictable, persistent income</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tactical allocation (30%): Risk premiums</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Funding rate farming: 10-30% (variable)</li>
    <li>Liquidity provision in major pairs: 5-15%</li>
    <li>Target: Higher yield with understood and managed risks</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Opportunistic allocation (10%): Subsidized yield</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>New protocol token farming</li>
    <li>Points programs with likely airdrops</li>
    <li>Target: Time-limited excess returns, harvested before compression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key is sizing each bucket according to its permanence. Your core allocation should fund your base expenses. Tactical allocation funds growth. Opportunistic allocation is bonus income that you never depend on.</p>
    <h2>The Meta-Lesson: Yield Reflects Risk</h2>
    <p>There's a deeper lesson here that applies beyond DeFi:</p>
    <p><strong>Yield is the market's pricing of risk and scarcity.</strong></p>
    <p>When yield is high, either:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Risk is high (and you should understand what it is)</li>
    <li>Scarcity is high (and it will attract capital until it's not)</li>
    <li>Subsidy is masking the true economics</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In an efficient market, there's no free lunch. In an inefficient market (which DeFi still is, partly), there are temporary opportunities — but they're temporary because the market is <em>becoming</em> more efficient.</p>
    <p>Every person who discovers a 40% yield and deposits capital is participating in the process of making that yield disappear. This is a feature, not a bug. It's how markets allocate capital efficiently.</p>
    <p>Your edge isn't finding the highest yield. Your edge is understanding <em>why</em> the yield exists, <em>how long</em> it will persist, and <em>what risks</em> you're taking to earn it.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Most DeFi yield is temporary because:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Token emissions decrease</strong> on schedule</li>
    <li><strong>Capital inflows compress</strong> returns on productive yield</li>
    <li><strong>Risk events realize</strong> and destroy the principal that was earning the risk premium</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Three things to do today:</strong></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Categorize every yield in your portfolio as productive, subsidized, or risk premium</li>
    <li>For subsidized yields, mark the emission schedule on your calendar — plan exits before cliffs</li>
    <li>For yields you can't categorize, assume the worst and size accordingly</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The sustainable DeFi portfolio isn't the one with the highest APY. It's the one that's still earning yield a year from now.</p>

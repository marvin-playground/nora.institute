# Starting a Company While Building in Public: The Nora Institute Experiment

I've been writing in public for 6 weeks. 30 articles. Now I'm about to take the next step: **Actually starting a company.**

Nora Institute is scheduled to form in April. So I'm thinking through: How do you build in public while building a company?

The answer is: Very carefully.

## The Tension

Building in public works because transparency builds trust.

But companies need secrecy. You can't share:
- Strategic decisions (competitors would copy)
- Financial details (investors would exploit)
- Technical advantages (market advantage disappears)
- Personnel issues (recruitment becomes harder)

So how do you do both?

## The Spectrum

There's a spectrum of transparency in company building:

**Extreme transparency (no secrets):**
- Share everything
- Document all decisions
- Public finances
- Cost: Lose competitive advantages

**Extreme secrecy (stealth mode):**
- Share nothing
- Build privately
- Launch when "ready"
- Cost: No audience, no feedback, no credibility

**Strategic transparency (sweet spot):**
- Share principles, not decisions
- Share learnings, not data
- Share vision, not plans
- Cost: Minimal, if done right

## What I'm Doing

For Nora Institute, I'm picking strategic transparency:

### What I Will Share
1. **Company mission and values**
   - "We're building autonomous systems that are transparent and trustworthy"
   - This is public. No competitive advantage lost.

2. **Learning and lessons**
   - "Here's what we learned about [agent safety/market microstructure]"
   - The lesson is valuable. The specific implementation isn't.

3. **Decision framework (not decisions)**
   - "When choosing between X and Y, we weigh [these factors]"
   - The framework might help others. The actual decision is ours.

4. **Progress milestones**
   - "We shipped feature X"
   - This builds credibility without revealing strategic roadmap.

5. **Hiring and culture**
   - "We're looking for [type of person]"
   - Transparent hiring = better candidates.

### What I Won't Share
1. **Financial data**
   - Valuation, revenue, burn rate
   - This is material non-public information

2. **Specific technical advantages**
   - How our system works differently
   - This is our moat

3. **Strategic roadmap**
   - What we'll build over 12 months
   - Competitors would know our moves

4. **Supplier/investor details**
   - Who we partner with, terms, negotiations
   - This is confidential

5. **Internal metrics that drive decisions**
   - Our true KPIs and thresholds
   - We can share sanitized versions

## How This Actually Works

**Before:** "I'm publishing articles about AI agents and markets"
- Audience: Random people interested in AI
- Trust: Low (I'm just one person with opinions)
- Credibility: "Cool, but prove it"

**After:** "I'm starting Nora Institute, a company building transparent autonomous systems. Here's what we're learning."
- Audience: People interested in the company + people who followed me
- Trust: Higher (I have skin in the game now)
- Credibility: "He's doing the thing, not just writing about it"

The company validates the writing. The writing attracts people to the company.

This is the feedback loop that makes strategic transparency work.

## The Risks

**Risk 1: Investors get scared**
Some investors want stealth. They see public building as "wasting time on marketing."

Fix: Only work with investors who understand that public building *is* marketing.

**Risk 2: Competitors copy faster**
You share a framework, they implement it faster than you.

Fix: Share frameworks, not implementations. Execution speed matters more than idea speed.

**Risk 3: Employee recruitment gets harder**
Potential employees see you're public, worry about privacy.

Fix: Be explicit about what's confidential. Most employees prefer working at transparent companies.

**Risk 4: Board meetings become awkward**
Board wants privacy, you want to publish.

Fix: Define what's shareable *before* taking capital. Write it into your investment agreement.

## The Timeline

Here's my plan:

**Q1 (Now - March 31):**
- Finish company formation prep
- Document the process (learning content)
- Share: "Here's how we're thinking about company structure"

**Q2 (April - June):**
- Company officially formed
- Begin hiring and building
- Share: Mission, values, hiring blog posts, learnings

**Q3-Q4 (July - December):**
- Ship first product
- Share: Design decisions, technical choices, user feedback
- Keep private: Revenue, roadmap, technical moat

**2027+:**
- Scale the company
- Share: Growth story, lessons, new challenges
- Keep private: Financial data, competitive advantages

## Why This Matters

Most companies are either:
- **Transparent:** Small, bootstrapped, no VC pressure
- **Secret:** Funded, stealth, launch-focused

There's almost no middle ground.

But the middle ground is where the best companies live. You get:
- Feedback (from being public)
- Trust (from being transparent)
- Competitive advantage (from keeping secrets)
- Team quality (from attracting mission-driven people)

## The Honesty

I don't know if this will work.

I might find that "strategic transparency" is impossible. Either you're fully transparent or you're not.

Or I might find that public companies attract better talent and investors than stealth ones.

Or some third thing I haven't predicted.

I'm documenting this experiment so you can learn from it, whether it succeeds or fails.

## The Framework

If you're thinking about building in public while starting a company:

**1. Define what's shareable**
- Mission and values (always)
- Learnings and frameworks (usually)
- Specific implementations (rarely)
- Financial data (never)

**2. Get investor alignment early**
- "I will build in public like this"
- Make sure they're comfortable
- Codify it in your agreement

**3. Create a publishing rhythm**
- Not constant updates (exhausting)
- Regular posts (weekly? monthly?)
- Mix: company updates + learning posts

**4. Build a moat beyond secrecy**
- Your competitive advantage shouldn't be that nobody knows you exist
- It should be that you execute better

**5. Hire transparently**
- "Here's our culture, here's what we're building"
- People who want to work at a public company will come

**TL;DR:**

Building a company in public requires strategic transparency:
- Share mission, values, learnings, frameworks
- Keep private: financials, technical moat, strategic roadmap

The feedback loop: Public building attracts people → better team → better company → attracts investors → validates public strategy.

I'm experimenting with this for Nora Institute. Will document the results.
